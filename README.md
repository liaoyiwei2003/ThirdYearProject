# ThirdYearProject
This project aims to enhance the performance and robustness of image classification mod
els by exploring new, advanced data augmentation techniques. Specifically, it focuses on
 developing a custom mixed sample data augmentation strategy based on a semantic seg
mentation model that performs object detection on the input image and then generates
 hybrid images that contain both useful object information from the original input image
 for different image datasets
